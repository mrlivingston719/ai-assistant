# Current Deployment Status

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing - Changes Not Yet Deployed

## 🎯 Current State

### ✅ **Code Changes Completed (Not Deployed)**
1. **Architecture Simplified** - Removed over-engineered components
2. **Signal Integration Fixed** - Corrected container vs host installation issues  
3. **Setup Script Enhanced** - Added forced cleanup and rebuild capability
4. **Container Naming Fixed** - Renamed service to avoid duplication
5. **Documentation Updated** - All docs reflect current simplified architecture

### 🔧 **Latest Changes Made (Pending Deployment)**

#### Setup Script Improvements (`setup.sh`)
- ✅ Added `cleanup_previous_deployment()` function
- ✅ Forces removal of old containers and images
- ✅ Prunes Docker build cache
- ✅ Runs cleanup automatically at start of setup
- ✅ Removed Signal CLI host installation (containerized only)
- ✅ Updated instructions for container-based Signal CLI operations

#### Container Architecture Fix (`docker-compose.yml`)
- ✅ Renamed service: `assistant` → `api`
- ✅ Container name: `ai-assistant-api` (no duplication)
- ✅ Signal CLI properly containerized via Dockerfile

#### Dockerfile Signal CLI Fix
- ✅ Added verbose logging and error checking
- ✅ Explicit version specification and verification
- ✅ Proper directory creation and symlink setup

#### Documentation Cleanup
- ✅ Removed all Gmail integration references
- ✅ Updated all docs to reflect Signal-only communication
- ✅ Corrected architecture descriptions in README, CLAUDE.md, etc.

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture**

### Container Setup (Not Yet Deployed)
- **PostgreSQL** (`assistant-postgres`): Structured data storage
- **ChromaDB** (`assistant-chromadb`): Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **FastAPI** (`ai-assistant-api`): Main application with Signal integration
- **Ollama** (host): Local LLM service

### Signal Integration
- **Signal CLI**: Installed inside Docker container only
- **Communication**: "Note to Self" pattern with end-to-end encryption
- **Device Linking**: Must be done inside container after deployment

## 🚨 **Previous Issues Identified**

### Issue 1: Over-Engineering (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Dependency injection, custom exceptions, health monitoring
- **Solution**: Simplified to direct service initialization in main.py

### Issue 2: Signal CLI Architectural Confusion (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Installing Signal CLI on both host and container
- **Solution**: Container-only installation via Dockerfile

### Issue 3: Docker Build Caching (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Failed Signal CLI installation cached, preventing fixes
- **Solution**: Forced cleanup and rebuild in setup.sh

### Issue 4: Container Naming (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `ai-assistant-assistant` (duplicate naming)
- **Solution**: Renamed service to `api` → `ai-assistant-api`

## 📋 **Next Steps for Testing**

### 1. **Test Setup Script**
```bash
cd ~/ai-assistant
./setup.sh
```
**Expected:** Clean previous deployment, rebuild from scratch

### 2. **Verify Container Deployment**
```bash
docker compose ps
```
**Expected:** All containers healthy, including `ai-assistant-api`

### 3. **Test Signal CLI in Container**
```bash
docker exec -it ai-assistant-api signal-cli --version
```
**Expected:** Signal CLI version displayed

### 4. **Verify Application Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
**Expected:** HTTP 200 with service status

### 5. **Link Signal Device**
```bash
docker exec -it ai-assistant-api signal-cli link -n "AI Assistant"
```
**Expected:** QR code for Signal app linking

## 🔍 **Validation Checklist**

- [ ] Setup script completes without errors
- [ ] All containers start and reach healthy status
- [ ] Signal CLI available inside container
- [ ] FastAPI application responds to health checks
- [ ] Signal device linking works
- [ ] Application can process test messages via Signal

## 🐛 **Known Potential Issues**

### If Setup Fails
- Check Docker installation and permissions
- Verify Ollama is running on host
- Check network connectivity for downloads

### If Signal CLI Still Missing
- Check Dockerfile build output for errors
- Verify Java installation in container
- Check Signal CLI download URL accessibility

### If Containers Don't Start
- Check .env file configuration
- Verify PostgreSQL password is set
- Check port conflicts (8080, 5432, 8000)

## 📝 **Configuration Ready**

### Environment Variables (Configured)
- ✅ `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Generated securely
- ✅ `SIGNAL_PHONE_NUMBER`: User-provided during setup
- ✅ `NOTION_TOKEN`: Optional, can be added later

### Application Structure
- ✅ Simplified service initialization in main.py
- ✅ Direct service access via getter functions
- ✅ Basic error handling without over-engineering
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints for meetings and Signal

**Status Summary:** All code changes complete and ready for deployment testing. The architecture has been simplified, Signal integration corrected, and setup script enhanced for reliable rebuilds. Next step is to run `./setup.sh` and validate the deployment.
